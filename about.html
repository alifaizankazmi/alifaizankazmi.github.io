## About

A determined computer scientist with a mind that appreciates complexity and enjoys devising solutions to difficult problems. I'm not daunted at the prospect of having to solve problems in an unfamiliar domain as I aspire to view every problem at an abstract level: as a set of tasks to be completed using:  

* a set of domain-specific rules
* the rules of logical inference
* creativity
  
I specialise in object-oriented programming but pursue an active interest in functional programming as well. I'm also at home with relational DBMSs and have experience of using data mining software packages such as IBM SPSS and Weka.  

In my spare time I enjoy reading and writing poetry, and studying philosophy to exercise my mind.
